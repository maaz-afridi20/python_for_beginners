print("hi")
#as all of the old concept.
# introduction to type function.

#a = 38
#print(type(a)) #this wil show that what type of variable it is.
#all the variables names ara case sensitives.
#a= 5
h = 55
print("the value of 5 + 55 is  " , 5+55) #arithmetic operators.
b = 5
b += 10 # this will add 10 to the first value of b whichi is 5
print(b) # so now its value will be 15
#the same is the case with when we put - in front just like we put +
#and that will - that number from that number.

j = 10
j -= 5
print(j)

s = 5
s *= 4 # this will multiply 4 with 5. and also we can divide with just likt that.
print(s)


#COMPARISON OPERATORS.

z = (5>4)
print(z) #this will through out TRUE. and wise versa.
# the comparison operators will through out boolean.


#LOGICAL OPERATORS.
# Some of them are as......
# AND,NOT,OR

# and will trough TRUE  when both are true.
# or   will trough TRUE when any of ther is true.
# not is use only for one variable.


#typecasting.(to change one variable to another.)

a = "5934"
a = int(a)
print(type(a))
print(a + 6) #this will show 5940
#type casting is the way to convert one data type to another.


#INPUT FUNCTION.

# my = input("enter your name.")
# print( "My name is " , my)

nmber = input("enter your numer.")
nmber = int(nmber)
print(nmber)
print(type(nmber))
